In case you missed all the excitement yesterday, Joel Spolsky sent out [a tweet](https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/13378100615) inviting his followers to join in what turned out to be Stack Overflow’s first-ever chat Q&A.





The Stack Overflow teams have been experimenting with chat to help coordinate their development efforts in real time. After a flurry of publicity from the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/05/04/04readwriteweb-all-star-team-backs-stackoverflow-to-go-bey-17026.html), [San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/05/04/businessinsider-stackoverflow-qa-site-for-programmers-raises-6-million-from-all-star-investors-2010-5.DTL), [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/stackoverflow-qa-site-for-programmers-raises-6-million-from-all-star-investors-2010-5), and [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/stackoverflow_business_funding.php), this seemed like the perfect opportunity to see how a chat room would work for Q&A.





We needed a fast, informal public gathering to answer questions about the financing deal just announced. Joel opened a chat room to the public and tweeted an open invitation to his followers. Within moments, the chat room filled to capacity. We upgraded the room to hold 100 users and waited for the joining messages to clear. 





The chat room was busy and, at times, chaotic. But after filtering out all the noise, what remains is a lot of valuable information generated in a short period of time.
