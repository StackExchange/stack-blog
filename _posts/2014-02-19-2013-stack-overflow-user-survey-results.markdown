In 2013, our Stack Overflow community grew from 21.5 million to 26.9 million monthly visitors from 242 countries around the world. We're doing a lot to keep growing with the community -- we now have localized versions of Careers 2.0 for French and German audiences, we're developing [iOS](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app) and [Android](http://blog.stackexchange.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/) mobile apps for our entire network, and our first ever [localized](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/) version of Stack Overflow with [the Portuguese site](http://pt.stackoverflow.com/) currently in beta. As a way for us to make sure we're doing the most for our users and community on Stack Overflow, we conduct a survey every year to see what you're up to, how you're using our site and what else is on your mind. This year, we analyzed a survey sample of 7,500 responses from 96 countries. As a thank you for the time you spent filling it out, we donated an additional $12,000 to our [Stack Exchange Charities](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/stack-exchange-gives-back-2013-2/).


## Observations


**This is the second year we’re calling out mobile, and yes mobile is still growing.**

While only 7.9% of you classified your occupation as a Mobile Application Developer, the majority of respondents (51.5%!) said that their company has a native mobile app. This is an increase from 2012 when 48.2% of respondents had a mobile app.

**Android continues to climb while iPhone declines**

Not only is the Android Phone the most popular mobile device with 63.8% of respondents saying they have one, the most popular native mobile platform supported is an Android Phone app with 39.5%. The iPhone lost more traction with developers this year with 30.7% of respondents saying they own an iPhone compared to 35.2% in 2012.

**Working Remotely**

As our Stack Exchange team is growing and [we have more employees working remote](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/), we added a number of questions about remote work. While only 10.6% of respondents said they are full-time remote, 63.9% of total respondents say they work remotely at least occasionally.

Here’s a special infographic to sum up our survey findings. If you’d like to do your own analysis you can [download the survey results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16C6ZeNSvd-qIg45J9E-vx2YCsD8w5oZaSTUtJ-52e-w/edit?usp=sharing).
